getter and setter are used to make sure the other classes can use the varible of other when they are private 

and  aslo making varible and functions by keeping private to not to collide each other is called encapsulation 

**
stright answer  if the methods are public and the varibles are private that is encapsulation  

****
make sure that the class which is public that should be the file name  but it doesn't  mean
that it have main function , you can create other class with out public and add a main class init

file name is carowner.java
public class  carowner{

    private int age;
    private String name;
}
class  cardelear{

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {

       


    }
}
